# Over reliance on a single feature
Feature importance: gene expression 0.98

# Gene expression is required for essentiality

Consistent with the literature (Hart et al, 2014)

# Removing gene expression worsens performance

Count differential: 0.75 (feature importance)

# Misclassified gene

Misclassification not always a problem with overlap distribution. 
The gene at -15 is an 'essential' gene classified as 'non-essential'

# Misclassified genes differ without expression

# Future work

* Consider using gene expression information when analyzing CRISPR screen information. 
* Additional consideration of count deciles may be useful, as guides in lower deciles may have less drastic count differentials and my be more difficult to interpret. 
* Evaluate additional models or statistical tests for evaluating CRISPR screens (Zhao et al., 2022).
