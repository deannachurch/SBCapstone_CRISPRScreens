  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pooled CRISPR screen is a promising tool in drug
              targets or essential genes identification with the utilization of
              three different systems including CRISPR knockout (CRISPRko),
              CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa).
              Aside from continuous improvements in technology, more and more
              bioinformatics methods have been developed to analyze the data
              obtained by CRISPR screens which facilitate better understanding
              of physiological effects. RESULTS: Here, we provide an overview on
              the application of CRISPR screens and bioinformatics approaches to
              analyzing different types of CRISPR screen data. We also discuss
              mechanisms and underlying challenges for the analysis of dropout
              screens, sorting-based screens and single-cell screens.
              CONCLUSION: Different analysis approaches should be chosen based
              on the design of screens. This review will help community to
              better design novel algorithms and provide suggestions for wet-lab
              researchers to choose from different analysis methods.",

              powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences
              of gene disruption: genes that are crucial for the function of an
              organism will be depleted of such variants in natural populations,
              whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation.
              However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for
              annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low
              frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation
              and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of
              125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies
              into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769
              high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort
              after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation
              errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we
              classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that
              represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification
              using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and
              show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery

              present genome-wide libraries for CRISPRi (Dolcetto) and CRISPRa
              (Calabrese), and show in negative selection screens that Dolcetto,
              with fewer sgRNAs per gene, outperforms existing CRISPRi libraries
              and achieves comparable performance to CRISPRko in detecting
              essential genes. We also perform positive selection CRISPRa
              screens and demonstrate that Calabrese outperforms the SAM
              approach at identifying vemurafenib resistance genes. We further
              compare CRISPRa to genome-scale libraries of open reading frames

              RNA interference, or complete gene knockout, using new CRISPR
